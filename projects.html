          <h2><cite>Popular:  Summer School/Senior Year</cite></h2>
          <p>This fanfiction project was the main <i>raison d'Ãªtre</i> for my old website back in the early 2000s.  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202748/"><cite>Popular</cite></a> was a series set in a Southern California high school, airing on the WB (long before it merged with UPN to become the CW) for two seasons between 1999 and 2001.  It was the first TV series created by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614682/">Ryan Murphy</a>, who would go on to create such series as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nip/Tuck"><cite>Nip/Tuck</cite></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)"><cite>Glee</cite></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story"><cite>American Horror Story</cite></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1_(TV_series)"><cite>9-1-1</cite></a>.</p>
          <p><cite>Summer School</cite> is an eight-episode miniseries which wrapped up Season Two's storylines, and <cite>Senior Year</cite> is a 24-episode third season (19 episodes of which are complete).  I did most of the work on this between 2001 and 2003, but have continued to put out episodes sporadically in the years since, and still hope to finish the entire series at some point.  Almost everything can still be found at <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/73108/Wild-Pikachu">FanFiction.net</a>, but I published them on my own website to have control over the formatting (they are in script format, which FanFiction.net doesn't really like).  One of the first things I intend to do when I get a new website up and running is to recreate the <cite>Popular</cite> secton.</p>

          <h2><cite>The Mark of Rhekos</cite></h2>
          <p>Another piece of old fanfiction, this one a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer"><cite>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</cite></a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmed"><cite>Charmed</cite></a> crossover.  Chapter One was written way back in 2001, but I added a second chapter about seven or eight years ago, so I think this is technically just dormant, not dead.  It was originally supposed to be saga-length (and will probably never be done), but I might still add to it from time to time.</p>

          <h2><cite>The Darker Side of Night</cite></h2>
          <p>My main project, a detective novel set in the 24<sup>th</sup> century.  It's a very old concept (I can trace its origins back to a story idea I had in high school), but I've been working slowly but steadily on it for the past few years, and it's currently at about 43,000 words.  Since my writing pace makes George R.R. Martin look speedy, I don't know when it will ever be finished, and I don't know if I will put it up online when it is (though Andy Weir did that, and it turned out fairly well for him).  But we'll see.</p>

          <h2><cite>Dynasties</cite></h2>
          <p>One of a few side projects that I turn to when I want to write something different.  This one is pure space opera, about interstellar intrigue and betrayal, and it's potentially YA fiction (its heroine is a 16-year-old girl).  It's also a recreation&mdash;I wrote several chapters in the 1990s, which were subsequently lost.  Over the past few years I've been sporadically rewriting and enhancing what I can remember of the original.</p>

        <article class="card">
          <h2><cite>Vengeance Deferred</cite></h2>
          <p>Another space opera, about an ancient, far-flung alien empire which suddenly finds itself facing a relentless invasion from an unknown enemy.  A bit of an oddity because, although I am writing it in prose, I actually envision it more as a TV series (there are some inflection points where visual reveals would be more effective than written ones)...  This one I think I may put online as it goes along, because I don't think it would come to much commercially.</p>

        <article class="card">
          <h2><cite>Pericles 2038</cite></h2>
          <p>Finally, another oddity, a "web serial" (from back in the early 2000s when such things were briefly popular) about the goings-on aboard a private space station orbiting Earth.  I had two or three chapters online at one point, and (more importantly) it had a fully-formed website, with dynamic menus, a guestbook, message board and counter, all of the turn-of-the-century bells and whistles.  This might also go back up on a new website (since it would need very little tweaking to be functional).</p>

          <h2>Statute Viewer</h2>
          <p>An entirely different project, arising from my work in dealing with social services legislation.  This started, about ten years ago, as a cataloging of public welfare laws that showed what was actually changed (which legislation in its final published form doesn't do).  As a <a href="Statutes_page.pdf">print document</a>, it has become very large&mdash;the latest version, which spans a little over a century of statutes, runs around 3500 pages&mdash;and it's occurred to me that it would probably be much more useful as a web application.  Ideally, users would be able to trace the evolution of sections of law over time, as well as compare different versions of a law from different times.</p>
