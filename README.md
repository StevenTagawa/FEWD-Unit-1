# FEWD-Unit-1
 Project #1 of the Treehouse FEWD Techdegree

These webpages have been coded to "Exceed Expectations."

Note that within interests.html and projects.html, the articles are grouped inside <div> tags.  This is deliberate:  I needed to group the articles inside a container within <main> in order to add text that wouldn't flex above them, and according to the HTML validator <section> tags are not appropriate for that purpose.

These webpages have been tested with Chrome, Firefox and Edge.  The transitions don't seem to work with Edge; everything else is the same on all browsers.
